🧩 Task 1 — Top-level tabs (outside menu)

Goal
Add top navigation tabs visible on the main dashboard (not inside the profile/menu):

Change Orders

Projects & Expenses

Business & Insights (combined)

Files (likely)
client/src/App.tsx, client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx (or equivalent), client/src/routes/*, client/src/components/ui/*tabs*

Edits

Insert a tabbed nav bar near the header.

Wire tabs to routes: /change-orders, /projects, /business.

Keep existing styling (Tailwind/shadcn). Default active: Projects & Expenses.

Manual Test

Load dashboard → see three tabs at top.

Clicking each tab navigates to the correct page.

Acceptance Criteria

 Tabs render outside the menu.

 Routes switch correctly without breaking existing pages.

 Visual style matches current app.

Guardrails

Do not remove existing menu; just stop using it for these three pages.

No refactors beyond nav/header and routes.

🧩 Task 2 — Manual project creation (Projects & Expenses)

Goal
Allow users to manually create a new Project from Projects & Expenses.

Files (likely)
Client: client/src/pages/projects/*.tsx, client/src/components/projects/NewProjectDialog.tsx
Server: server/routes/projects.ts, server/db/schema/projects.ts (Drizzle)

Edits

Add a “New Project” button opening a form: name, clientName, category, totalAmount.

Add POST /api/projects to create a project record.

Manual Test

Click “New Project” → fill form → submit → new project shows in list.

Acceptance Criteria

 New project is persisted and visible in list.

 Form validation for required fields.

 No changes to existing quotation→project auto logic.

Guardrails

Do not affect auto-creation on approval.

No schema renames.

🧩 Task 3 — Auto-convert approved quotation → Project

Goal
When a quotation’s status becomes approved, create a Project if it doesn’t already exist (no duplicates).

Files (likely)
Server: server/routes/quotations.ts, server/services/quotationService.ts, server/db/schema/projects.ts

Edits

In PATCH/PUT for quotation status, when transitioning to approved, upsert a project from quotation fields.

Add unique constraint on projects.quotationId if not present.

Manual Test

Approve a quotation → project appears once.

Re-approve doesn’t create duplicates.

Acceptance Criteria

 Exactly one project per approved quotation.

 Existing quotations list unchanged.

Guardrails

Do not delete quotations.

No UI changes beyond resulting project visibility.

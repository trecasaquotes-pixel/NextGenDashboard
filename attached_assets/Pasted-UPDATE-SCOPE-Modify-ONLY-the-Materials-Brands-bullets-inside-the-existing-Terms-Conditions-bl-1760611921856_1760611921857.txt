UPDATE SCOPE: Modify ONLY the “Materials & Brands” bullets inside the existing Terms & Conditions block (for both Interiors and False Ceiling PDFs). Do NOT change any other T&C text, layout, or styles.

GOAL: Make the Core Materials, Finishes, and Hardware bullets dynamic based on selections in the quotation. If no selections exist, fall back to current static text.

WHERE:
• The T&C renderer component used on the Print/Agreement PDFs (Interiors + FC). 
• Keep current container, fonts, spacing, and heading exactly as is.

DATA TO READ:
• For each interiors/false-ceiling line item:
  - coreMaterial (string)
  - finish (string)
  - hardware (string)
• Project defaults (if present):
  - defaults.coreMaterial
  - defaults.finish
  - defaults.hardware

LOGIC:
1) Build three distinct sets from all items (include project defaults for items without explicit values):
   - CoreSet = unique coreMaterial values
   - FinishSet = unique finish values
   - HardwareSet = unique hardware brands
   * Normalize by trimming and case-insensitive de-dupe.

2) Compose exactly these bullets (replace only the bold parts with dynamic content):
   • Core Materials: **{CoreSet}** as per approved design requirements. (Blockboard is not used in any scope of work).
   • Finishes: **{FinishSet}** unless otherwise specified.
   • Hardware: **{HardwareSet}{OrEquivalent}**, with soft-close mechanisms where applicable.
   • Glass & Metal Works: (LEAVE THIS BULLET EXACTLY AS IS, unchanged and static.)

3) “OrEquivalent” rule:
   - If HardwareSet has 2+ brands → append “, or equivalent”
   - If exactly 1 brand → omit “, or equivalent”

4) Friendly finish phrasing rules (light hints; only when thickness not already in the label):
   - If value contains “External Laminate” or generic “Laminate” without thickness → use “External laminates (1.0 mm)”
   - If value contains “Internal Laminate” → “Internal laminates (0.8 mm)”
   - If value contains “Acrylic” without thickness → “Acrylic (1.5 mm for kitchens)”
   - If value contains “PU” or “Duco” → keep as “PU-Duco as per design”
   - Otherwise use the raw label

5) If a category’s set is empty, keep the current static sentence for that category.

STYLE / LAYOUT:
• Keep the existing T&C font (Montserrat), size, bullets, and spacing unchanged.
• No extra headings, no new sections.
• Ensure line wrapping prevents clipping in PDF.

ACCEPTANCE:
• Changing any line item’s core/finish/hardware updates these bullets in preview + generated PDFs.
• No duplicate brand/material names appear (case-insensitive).
• Hardware “or equivalent” appears only when 2+ brands exist.
• All other T&C content remains exactly as is.

TEST:
• Case A: Mix of “BWP/BWR (710 Grade Plywood)”, “HDHMR”; finishes “External Laminate”, “Acrylic”, “PU-Duco”; hardware “Hettich”, “Nimmi”.
• Case B: Single hardware brand → no “or equivalent”.
• Case C: No selections anywhere → original static bullets remain.
